<h3>Abstract</h3>
<hr>

This study aims to estimate flights delays based on US TRANSTATS database 
provided on [https://www.transtats.bts.gov](URL)

<br>
The slides (`Openclassrooms_ParcoursDatascientist_P4-V1.pdf`) 
present the overall approach of the study.

<h3>Study Overview :</h3>
<hr>

 
* A Data model is built based on the dataset cleaning and exploratory analysis.

* The explicative variables are selected in order to remove data-leakage and 
data-correlation. 

* A model is built based on routes. Study of delay variances per routes lead to 
suggest assumptions on data model variables.

* Model is augmented with the US climatic model.

* Linear regressors are evaluated based on an exhautive cross-validation. 

* The best estimator among linear regression estimators is selected based on performances measures. 

* An software engineering scheme is showned for the model to be deployed.

* Deployement scheme on Hereku is presented.

* Conclusions present limits of this model and possibles propositions to increase 
preformances.
