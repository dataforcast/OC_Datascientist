# Set of projects 
<hr>

Projects carried out on behalf of the Master 2 Centrale Sup√©lec / Openclassrooms training in datasience.

<br>
I'am a software engineer consultant with a mathematical background.
<br>

At the beginning of 2018, I decided to develop skills in Datasciences.

The professional projects presented here are the results of my apprenticeship.
