<br>
I'am a software engineer consultant with a mathematical background.
</br>

<br>
I started learning Data Sciences by 2014, using customers CRM databases to deliver insights serving sales and marketing services.

<br>
Then I decided to go indeep in Data Sciences skills to be able to deliver more value from Data Sciences technologies.

<br>
The professional projects presented here are the result of my "deep learning" of Data Sciences.<br>
