## <center><h1>P2 : Food recipe generator</h1></center>
<hr>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<hr>

This study aims to explore a food database in order to constitute a generator 
of healthy recipes.

Data are issued from Open food facts database  (See https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/)

A recipe is understood here as a combination of foods from the food database.


* The cleaning of the database is presented.

* An analysis of the model is carried out through the selection of relevant 
qualitative and quantitative variables. The relevance of these variables is
based on study hypotheses. These are presented in the introductory paragraph of 
the study report.

* The analysis of the relevant variables is carried out by univariate, bivariate studies,
concentration, dispersion and distribution measures.

* This analysis links the observations to a model underlying explanatory text.

* On the basis of this analysis, two scoring methods are proposed and compared
to the native scoring set by Open food facts.
 
* Recommendations are proposed for improving the scoring model.



## <center><h1>P4 : Flights delay estimator</h1></center>
<hr>

<br><br><br>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<hr>

This study aims to estimate flights delays based on US TANSTATS database 
provided on https://www.transtats.bts.gov

The slides (Openclassrooms_ParcoursDatascientist_P4-V1.pdf) 
present the overall approach of the study.

Study steps :

* A Data model is built based on the dataset cleaning and exploratory analysis.

* The explicative variables are selected in order to remove data-leakage and 
data-correlation. 

* A model is built based on routes. Study of delay variances per routes lead to 
suggest assumptions on data model variables.

* Model is augmented with the US climatic model.

* Linear regressors are evaluated based on an exhautive cross-validation. 

* The best estimator is selected based on performances measures. 

* An software engineering scheme is showned for the model to be deployed.

* Deployement scheme on Hereku is presented.

* Conclusions present limits of this model and possibles propositions to increase 
preformances.
